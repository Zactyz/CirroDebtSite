Core Features
Smart Matching
Group with people who share your debt profile—similar balances, rates, and goals—for equitable payoff progress.

Pooled Payments
Contribute your minimum plus a small extra each month. All extras combine into a “snowball” that tackles the highest‑cost debt in the group.

Budgeting Suite
Easy expense tracker and budget planner to help you free up extra cash for the group pot.

Progress Dashboard
Visual charts and milestones show individual and group payoff status in real time.

Secure & Compliant
Bank‑grade encryption, transparent algorithms, and clear legal agreements keep your money and data safe.

How It Works
Sign Up & Onboard
Quickly enter your debts, interest rates, minimums, and budget details.

Get Matched
Our algorithm groups you with peers who have similar debt profiles and timelines.

Contribute Monthly
Make your required payment plus a small extra. All extras flow into the group’s “snowball” pot.

Snowball Payoff
The pooled funds attack the highest‑interest debt first. As each balance clears, your freed‑up minimum rolls into the next target—both for you and your group.
